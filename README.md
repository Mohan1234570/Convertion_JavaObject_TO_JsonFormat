This project is aimed at providing a simple and efficient solution for converting Java objects to JSON format. It provides a convenient way to serialize Java objects into JSON strings, making it easy to integrate Java applications with JSON-based web services or APIs.

Features:
Java to JSON Conversion: Serialize Java objects into JSON format.
Customization: Support for customizing JSON output using annotations or configuration options.
Support for Java Collections: Convert Java collections (List, Map, Set, etc.) into JSON arrays or objects.
Integration: Seamless integration with existing Java applications and frameworks.
Performance: Efficient conversion algorithms for optimal performance.
Installation
To use this library in your Java project, you can include it as a dependency using Maven, Gradle, or download the JAR file directly from the repository.

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.example</groupId>
    <artifactId>java-to-json-converter</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>

Getting Started:
Create Java Objects: Define your Java classes and objects that you want to serialize into JSON.
Serialize Objects: Use the provided APIs to serialize Java objects into JSON format.
Customization: Customize the JSON output using annotations or configuration options as needed.
Integration: Integrate the JSON output with your applications or APIs.

// Create an instance of the Java to JSON converter
JsonConverter converter = new JsonConverter();

// Serialize a Java object to JSON string
String json = converter.toJson(myObject);

// Deserialize JSON string to Java object
MyObject obj = converter.fromJson(json, MyObject.class);
